# Yazelix v7: Nix installs everything for you!

## Overview
Yazelix integrates Yazi, Zellij, and Helix, hence the name, get it?

- Zellij orchestrates everything, with Yazi as a sidebar and Helix as the editor
- To hide the sidebar, make your pane fullscreen! (`Ctrl p + f` or `Alt f`)
- Every keybinding from Zellij that conflicts with Helix is remapped [see here](#keybindings)
- When you hit Enter on a file/folder in the "sidebar":
  - If Helix is already open in the topmost pane of the stack (default position in latest Zellij version), it opens that file/folder in a new buffer in Helix
  - If Helix isn't open, it launches Helix in a new pane for you
  - It always finds a running Helix instance if it exists and is in the top pane of the stacked group (Zellij naturally pushes the Helix pane there, though it may move when deleting or creating panes)
  - It automatically renames the Zellij tab to the file's underlying Git repo or directory name
- Features include:
  - "Reveal file in sidebar" (press `Alt y` in Helix to reveal the file in Yazi, see [Keybindings](#keybindings))
  - A Yazi plugin to enhance the status bar in the sidebar pane, making it uncluttered, colorful, and showing file permissions
  - A [Git plugin](https://github.com/yazi-rs/plugins/tree/main/git.yazi) showing file changes in the Yazi sidebar
  - Dynamic column updates in Yazi (parent, current, preview) via the [auto-layout plugin](https://github.com/josephschmitt/auto-layout.yazi), perfect for sidebar use
- This project includes config files for Zellij, Yazi, terminal emulators, Nushell scripts, Lua plugins, and a lot of love
- See [boot sequence](./docs/boot_sequence.md) for details on how Yazelix starts up

## Vision
- Yazelix is always on the edge of project versions (do you like living on the edge, you know, dangerously?)
- Yazelix is always evolving, it's a living being
- Yazelix is easy to use and crazy at the same time (what really is this project?)
- Yazelix lets you say `I use Yazelix btw` (careful saying that, you might accidentally scare an innocent Arch user)
- Boy, do we Nix
- Integration, integration, integration

## Improvements of v7 over v6
- **Warning**: After upgrading to Yazelix v7, terminate any running zellij sessions and old terminals to prevent conflicts
- Introduces a Nix-based development environment via `flake.nix`, simplifying dependency installation and ensuring consistent versions for Zellij, Yazi, Helix, Nushell, lazygit, Starship, and other tools (recommended installation method)
- Adds [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), a fast, terminal-based Git TUI for managing Git repositories
- Adds [Starship](https://starship.rs), a customizable, fast prompt for Nushell, enhancing the terminal experience with Git status and contextual info
- Adds [markdown-oxide](https://oxide.md/index), a Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS) that works with your favorite text editor through LSP, inspired by and compatible with Obsidian
- Allows you to build Helix from source automatically
- Installs and configures dependencies automatically
- The `clip` command from [nuscripts](https://github.com/nushell/nuscripts) is included, allowing you to copy text to the system clipboard directly from Nushell. Use it like `ls src/*.py | get name | to text | clip`.
- Adds `launch-yazelix.sh` script to streamline setup by launching WezTerm with the Yazelix-specific config and automatically adding `yazelix` and `yzx` aliases to your shell configuration (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) and Nushell config, eliminating manual configuration steps
- Introduces dynamic Zellij configuration generation on demand using `nushell/scripts/generate-zellij-config.nu`, which combines Zellij's default settings with Yazelix-specific overrides from `zellij/yazelix-overrides.kdl`, making it easy to stay up-to-date with Zellij defaults while preserving custom settings

## Compatibility
- Terminal: WezTerm (required)
- Editor: Helix (supports both `helix` and `hx` binaries - works with all distributions)
- See the version compatibility table [here](./docs/table_of_versions.md) (now generated dynamically!)

## Instructions to Set It Up

### New to Nix? Don't Worry!

**What is Nix?** Nix is a powerful package manager that ensures reproducible, reliable software installations. Think of it like a super-powered version of `apt`, `brew`, or `chocolatey` that:
- âœ… Never breaks your system (installs are isolated)
- âœ… Allows multiple versions of the same software
- âœ… Makes it easy to share exact development environments
- âœ… Can completely uninstall without leaving traces

**Why does Yazelix use Nix?** It guarantees that everyone gets the exact same versions of tools (Yazi, Zellij, Helix, etc.) that work perfectly together, regardless of your operating system or existing software.

### Prerequisites
- **WezTerm terminal emulator** (required for Yazelix)
  - **Linux**: Install via your distribution's package manager or [download from WezTerm releases](https://github.com/wez-flong/wezterm/releases)
  - **macOS**: `brew install --cask wezterm` or [download from WezTerm website](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/installation.html)
  - **Verify installation**: Run `wezterm --version` to confirm it's working

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Install Nix Package Manager
We use the **Determinate Systems Nix Installer** - it's more reliable, faster, and includes modern features out of the box:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

**What this does:**
- Installs Nix with flakes and the modern CLI enabled automatically (no extra configuration needed!)
- Sets up proper file permissions and system integration
- Provides a reliable uninstaller if you ever want to remove Nix
- Works on Linux, macOS, and WSL2

**Follow the prompts** and restart your terminal when prompted.

#### 2. Verify Nix Installation
Test that Nix is working correctly:
```bash
nix --version
```
You should see output like `nix (Nix) 2.xx.x` with flakes enabled.
#### 3. Download Yazelix
Clone the Yazelix repository to your system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luccahuguet/yazelix ~/.config/yazelix
```

#### 4. Launch Yazelix for the First Time
Run the launch script to set everything up:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.config/yazelix/bash/launch-yazelix.sh
~/.config/yazelix/bash/launch-yazelix.sh
```

**What happens during first launch:**
- Downloads and installs all required tools (Yazi, Zellij, Helix, Nushell, etc.)
- Sets up configurations and integrations
- Adds convenient `yazelix` and `yzx` aliases to your shell
- Launches WezTerm with the Yazelix environment

**Wait for the process to complete** - this may take a few minutes on first run as Nix downloads and builds everything.

#### 5. Using Yazelix
After the initial setup, you can launch Yazelix anytime with:
```bash
yazelix  # or yzx for short
```

If the aliases aren't available immediately, restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc if using Zsh
```

### Alternative: CLI-Only Mode
To use Yazelix tools without starting the full interface:
```bash
nix develop --impure ~/.config/yazelix
```
This gives you access to all tools (helix, yazi, lazygit, etc.) in your current terminal.

### Installation Troubleshooting

**ðŸ”§ "WezTerm not found" Error**
- Ensure WezTerm is installed and in your PATH
- Try running `wezterm --version` to verify installation

**ðŸ”§ "curl: command not found"**
- Install curl first: `sudo apt install curl` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `brew install curl` (macOS)

**ðŸ”§ Nix Installation Fails**
- The Determinate Systems installer usually handles most issues automatically
- Check their [troubleshooting guide](https://install.determinate.systems/docs/troubleshooting) for specific problems
- For SELinux systems, see their [SELinux support documentation](https://install.determinate.systems/docs/selinux)

**ðŸ”§ "Permission denied" on first launch**
- Make sure you made the script executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/yazelix/bash/launch-yazelix.sh`
- Check that you have write permissions to `~/.config/yazelix`

**ðŸ”§ Yazelix tools not working after installation**
- Try restarting your terminal completely
- Source your shell config: `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`
- Verify Nix is working: `nix --version`

   This installs and configures:
   - Required:
     - [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi) (file manager and CLI)
     - [Zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) (terminal multiplexer)
     - [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) (editor, built from source by default)
     - [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html) (shell)
     - [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (fuzzy finder for Yazi)
     - [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) (smart directory navigation)
     - [Starship](https://starship.rs) (customizable prompt)
   - Optional (enabled by default in `yazelix.nix`): [cargo-update](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/cargo-update) (updates Rust crates), [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) (faster Rust tool installation), [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) (Git TUI), [mise](https://github.com/jdxcode/mise) (tool version manager), [ouch](https://github.com/ouch-org/ouch) (compression tool)
   - Yazi Extensions (enabled by default in `yazelix.nix`): `ffmpeg`, `p7zip`, `jq`, `poppler`, `fd`, `ripgrep`, `imagemagick` (extend Yazi's functionality, e.g., media previews, archives, search)
   - Sets environment variables: `YAZI_CONFIG_HOME` (points to `~/.config/yazelix/yazi`), `ZELLIJ_DEFAULT_LAYOUT` (set to `yazelix`), and `EDITOR` (automatically set to available Helix binary: `helix` or `hx`)
   - Configurable in `~/.config/yazelix/yazelix.nix`:
     - `build_helix_from_source` (default: `true`): Set to `false` to use the pre-built Helix from `nixpkgs` instead of building from source. Building from source ensures the latest Helix features (e.g., for `Alt y` to reveal files in Yazi) but takes longer. Using `nixpkgs` is faster but may use an older version; check compatibility in `./docs/table_of_versions.md`.
     - `include_optional_deps` (default: `true`): Set to `false` to exclude optional dependencies like `mise` and `lazygit`.
     - `include_yazi_extensions` (default: `true`): Set to `false` to exclude Yazi extension dependencies like `ffmpeg` and `poppler`.
     - `default_shell` (default: `"nu"`): Sets the default shell for Zellij when Yazelix starts.
       - Accepted values: `"nu"` (for Nushell), `"bash"`, `"fish"`, or `"zsh"`.
       - If this option is omitted from `yazelix.nix`, it defaults to `"nu"`.
       - Nushell, Bash, Fish, and Zsh are always installed by the Nix environment and available for use, regardless of this setting. This option only controls the default shell Zellij launches into.
       - **Fish users**: Fish inherits the environment with all tools (starship, zoxide, mise, etc.) available in PATH. Configure these in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` as desired.
       - **Zsh users**: Zsh inherits the environment with all tools (starship, zoxide, mise, etc.) available in PATH. Configure these in your `~/.zshrc` as desired.
     - `user_packages`: Add custom Nix packages with full Nix expressions: `user_packages = with pkgs; [ discord vlc ];`

6. (Optional) Make Yazelix's Yazi config your default (plugin-enhanced, width-adjusted):
   - For Nushell users, add to `~/.config/nushell/env.nu` (edit with `config env`):
     ```nushell
     $env.YAZI_CONFIG_HOME = "~/.config/yazelix/yazi"
     ```



## Notes
- Yazelix requires WezTerm, which is configured (via `~/.config/yazelix/terminal_configs/wezterm_nix/.wezterm.lua`) to run the `~/.config/yazelix/bash/start-yazelix.sh` script upon launch. The `launch-yazelix.sh` script initiates this process. The `start-yazelix.sh` script then sets up the Nix environment and starts Zellij.
- The `--impure` flag in `nix develop` allows access to the HOME environment variable, necessary for config paths.
- Tweak configs to make them yours; this is a starting point.
- For extra configuration, see: [WezTerm Docs](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/files.html) or [Ghostty Docs](https://ghostty.org/docs/config).
- Run `~/.config/yazelix/bash/launch-yazelix.sh` to launch Yazelix in Zellij.

## Why Use This Project?
- Easy to configure and personalize
- I daily-drive Yazelix and will always try to improve and maintain it
- Zero-conflict keybindings (no need to lock Zellij) and a powerful Yazi sidebar
- Cool Yazi plugins included out of the box
- Features like `reveal in Yazi` (from Helix) and opening files from Yazi in a Helix buffer
- Enhanced Git integration with `lazygit` and a customizable Starship prompt
- Nix-based setup ensures consistent, reproducible environments

## Initializer Scripts
See [docs/initializer_scripts.md](./docs/initializer_scripts.md) for details on how Yazelix generates and uses initializer scripts for Nushell and Bash/Zsh.

## Troubleshooting
See [docs/troubleshooting.md](./docs/troubleshooting.md) for help with setup issues, version compatibility, and debugging, including important notes for upgrading to v7.

## VS Code and Cursor Integration
Want to use Yazelix tools (Nushell, zoxide, starship, lazygit) in your VS Code or Cursor integrated terminal? See our [VS Code/Cursor integration guide](./docs/vscode_cursor_integration.md) for step-by-step setup instructions that give you the full Yazelix environment in your editor's terminal.

## Keybindings
Keybindings are discoverable in each tool (e.g., `~` in Yazi, `?` in lazygit). See [docs/keybindings.md](./docs/keybindings.md) for full details, custom keybindings, and usage tips.

## Tips
- Add more swap layouts as needed using the KDL files in `layouts`
- Use `lazygit`

## I'm Lost! Too Much Information
Start by learning Zellij on its own, then optionally Yazi, and re-read this README afterwards
