# Cursor Rules for Yazelix Project

## Terminal Command Rules
- When running terminal commands, use `nu -c` for nushell commands
- Use full paths like `/bin/mv` when PATH environment has issues
- Dont assume commands failed - check if they actually worked first
- Keep terminal commands simple and direct
- Always check the working directory before running commands

## Content Style Rules
- Use direct, no-nonsense, actionable tone in all responses
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow yazelix naming patterns: lowercase with hyphens for files, camelCase for variables
- Reference the three main tools: Yazi (file manager), Zellij (terminal multiplexer), Helix (editor)

## Project-Specific Rules
- Always consider the integration between Yazi, Zellij, and Helix when making changes
- When modifying shell scripts, test both Nushell and Bash compatibility
- When adding new dependencies to flake.nix, categorize them properly (essential, optional, or yazi extensions)
- Follow the existing structure: bash/, nushell/, yazi/, zellij/, terminal_configs/
- When updating documentation, ensure it reflects both Nix-based and Cargo-based installation methods

## File Organization Rules
- Maintain the existing folder structure and naming conventions
- Bash scripts go in bash/
- Nushell configs go in nushell/
- Yazi configs go in yazi/
- Zellij configs go in zellij/
- Terminal emulator configs go in terminal_configs/
- Documentation goes in docs/
- Keep related content organized in appropriate folders
