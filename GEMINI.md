# Gemini Rules for Yazelix Project

## General
- Yazelix user's happiness and ease of use are top priorities
- While Yazelix has its opinions, the project is moving towards greater flexibility and customization
- But good defaults and good experience are still more important than customization

## Content Style & Naming
- Adopt a direct, no-nonsense, and actionable tone.
- **File Naming**: Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., `start_yazelix.nu`).
